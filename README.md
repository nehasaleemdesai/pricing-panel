## My process

🏗️ Firstly, I structured and styled the desktop view of the Pricing Panel. Once I was content with the desktop view, I added media queries and relavant CSS for the mobile view of the Pricing Panel.

🎨 While styling, I first focused on aligning the Pricing Panel to the given design. Next, I applied styles to enhance the font size, weight, and family, ensuring a clean and modern look. To improve interactivity, I added active state effects, such as box-shadow, smooth transitions, and color changes, providing a polished and engaging user experience.

### Built with

📜 Semantic HTML5 markup
🎨 CSS custom properties
📐 Flexbox

### What I learned

📚 As a newbie still progressing through online courses in front-end development, I applied the @media rule and incorporate transition property.

### Continued development

✍️ Make a habit of writing comment lines for better feasibility.
📖 Enhance code readability.
🔄 Combine properties wherever possible to omit code redundancy.
